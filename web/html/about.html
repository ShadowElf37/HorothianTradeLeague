      <h6>What is Project Mercury?</h6>
      <p>Project Mercury is a long-term experiment in using a virtual currency to facilitate trade and fair, organized exaction between people. It's currently in a closed beta, with a planned deployment sometime late this semester or with the start of school next year. Most pages are under development, so this is by no means the final form of the website.</p>
