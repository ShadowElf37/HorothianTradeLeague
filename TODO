	Work (anyone can do):
		1. Streamline shutdown action (GET)
	    2. Spruce up all these pages
		3. Error messages for invalid login attempts, etc.
	    4. SID for better security than a cookie with account ID

	    1. Additional account page info; record transactions,
	    2. Match each account.html button with a page
	    3. Port forward


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html
		2. Overhaul of request handling, should be abstracted class like Response
		3. Market for online-hosted trade
		4. SSL

	Creative vision:
		1. Coalitions (shared pools) / Guilds (companies)
		2. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		3. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		4. Hunt submission
		5. Real about.html
		6. Some kind of news feed on home.html when logged in
		7. Real home.html
