Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0


IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
		1. navbar.cfg should vary for when logged in or not logged in
		2. Convert all (possible) actions to POST
		3. We may want a name and lastname separate from username; username to log in, or not at all
	    4. Signup page
	    5. Spruce up the login page
		6. Success/failure pages for certain actions
	    7. SID for better security than a cookie with account ID
	    8. Transaction page
	    9. Home page should be some kind of news feed, create other account menu-item

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    1. Additional account page info
	    2. Match each account.html button with a page
	    3. Port forward


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html
		2. Market for online-hosted trade
		3. SSL

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		3. Coalitions
		4. Hunt submission
