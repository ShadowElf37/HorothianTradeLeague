Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will have a solid base of useability for the final features


URGENT
    All done!


IMPORTANT
    1. Thread for eval/exec(input()) so we can do maintenance without restarting the server
	2. Improve page CSS and add "aesthetic features"
	3. Variables at top of main.py to determine availability of certain features - right now it's mostly Server().debug, should be more specific

	4. Account settings; ability to change password, etc.
	5. Unlockables/Progress page (for coalitions, hunt submission, etc.)


LESS IMPORTANT
    1. Overhaul of client request; should be abstracted class like Response, not a list of header options
    2. Validator cookie should be dynamic with session for increased security
    3. Scripting console.html

    4. Coalitions (shared pools) / Guilds (companies)
    5. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html


FINAL PRODUCT:
    1. SSL
    2. Port forward
    3. Treaty
    4. Real about.html
    5. Real home.html
    6. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
    7. Have dummy file with everyone in school for potential unlocking of the whitelist

    8. Hunt submission
    9. Market for online-hosted trade
    10. Real news.html
