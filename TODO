Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0


IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
		1. Login page (because user and pass are sent in the GET, they're visible in address bar; should be encrypted so spectators don't see, doesn't need to be very secure just anything but the password)
	    2. Signup page
		3. Success/failure pages for certain actions
	    4. SID for better security than a cookie with account ID
	    5. We may want a name and lastname separate from username
	    6. Modifications to CSS?

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    1. Account page
	    2. Port forward


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html
		2. Market for online-hosted trade

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		3. Coalitions
		4. Hunt submission
