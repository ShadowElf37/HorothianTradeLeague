Upon completion of all URGENT (and some IMPORTANT as deemed necessary) work, Project Mercury can move into a Closed Beta


URGENT
    All done!


IMPORTANT
    1. Thread for eval/exec(input()) so we can do maintenance without restarting the server
	2. Improve page CSS and add "aesthetic features"
	3. Passwords should be stored using homemade encryption (sha is too irreversible - yeah we sneaky like that)
	4. Change bans to IP as well

	5. Account settings; ability to change password, etc.
	6. Unlockables/Progress page (for coalitions, hunt submission, etc.)


LESS IMPORTANT
    1. Overhaul of client request; should be abstracted class like Response, not a list of header options
    2. Validator cookie should be dynamic with session for increased security
    3. Scripting console.html

    4. Coalitions (shared pools) / Guilds (companies)
    5. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html


FINAL PRODUCT:
    1. SSL
    2. Port forward
    3. Treaty
    4. Real about.html
    5. Real home.html
    6. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
    7. Have dummy file with everyone in school for potential unlocking of the whitelist

    8. Hunt submission
    9. Market for online-hosted trade
    10. Real news.html
