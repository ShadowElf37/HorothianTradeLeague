Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0

IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
	    1. Errors!
	    2. Record transaction date/time, last user activity date/time, etc.

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    All done!


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
	    1. Fix page <title>s, most are wrong
		2. Scripting console.html
		3. Overhaul of request handling; should be abstracted class like Response
		4. That last account.html button should be a messages page (can send and recv from any user)
		5. Improve page CSS and add "aesthetic features"
		6. Validator cookie should be dynamic with session for increased security
		7. SSL
		8. Input field tooltips (on question marks beside)
		9. Thread for eval/exec(input()) so we can do maintenance without restarting the server

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. Coalitions (shared pools) / Guilds (companies)
		3. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		4. Hunt submission
		5. Real about.html
		6. Some kind of news feed on home.html when logged in
		7. Real home.html
		8. Unlockables/Progress page (for coalitions, hunt submission, etc.)
		9. Treaty
		10. Market for online-hosted trade
		11. Port forward
