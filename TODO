Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0

IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
	    1. Error messages for invalid login attempts, etc. (use [[error]] with render kwargs; create error codes for everything possible)
		2. What should that last account.html button be for?
	    3. Spruce up all these pages

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    1. Additional account page info???


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html
		2. Overhaul of request handling; should be abstracted class like Response
		3. Validator cookie should be dynamic with session for increased security
		4. Port forward
		5. SSL
		6. Input field tooltips (on question marks beside)

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. Coalitions (shared pools) / Guilds (companies)
		3. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		4. Hunt submission
		5. Real about.html
		6. Some kind of news feed on home.html when logged in
		7. Real home.html
		8. Unlockables/Progress page (for coalitions, hunt submission, etc.)
		9. Treaty
		10. Market for online-hosted trade
