Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0


IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
		1. Login page
		2. We may want a name and lastname separate from username; username to log in
	    3. Signup page
		4. Success/failure pages for certain actions
	    5. SID for better security than a cookie with account ID
	    6. Login-page address-bar password encryption (because it uses GET and spectators can see URL; yes, we're using homemade encryption for this)
	    7. Transaction page

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    1. Additional account page info
	    2. Match each account.html button with a page
	    3. Port forward


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html
		2. Market for online-hosted trade
		3. SSL

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		3. Coalitions
		4. Hunt submission
