Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0


IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
		1. navbar.cfg should be able to vary when logged in or not logged in (like Login becomes Account instead of both present)
		2. Convert all (possible) actions to POST
	    3. Spruce up the login & signup pages
		4. Success/failure pages for login, etc.
	    5. SID for better security than a cookie with account ID
	    6. Transaction page
	    7. Home page should be some kind of news feed, create other account menu-item

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    1. Additional account page info
	    2. Match each account.html button with a page
	    3. Collect other information for accounts to display & record
	    4. Port forward


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html
		2. Market for online-hosted trade
		3. SSL

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		3. Coalitions
		4. Hunt submission
