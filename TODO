Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0


IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
	    1. Test render for page navigation-bar so we don't have to copy-paste every time
	    2. Success/failure pages for certain actions
		3. Login page
	    4. Signup page	    

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    1. Account page


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
