Work (anyone can do):
    5. Scripting console.html
    3. Using config.txt in http_server to set the folder names and file types that go in those folders (see server.py for current bad setup)

Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
    2. Adding more actions in main.py (login, etc.)
    4. Adding success/failure page responses for those actions
    6. Creating pages for each action to occur
