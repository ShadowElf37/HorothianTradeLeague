Upon completion of all IMPORTANT work, Project Mercury will be considered BETA and the version number will jump to v0.1.0.0


IMPORTANT
	Work (anyone can do):
		1. navbar.cfg should be able to vary when logged in or not logged in (like Login becomes Account instead of both present)
		2. Convert all (possible) actions to POST, remove redundant GET actions
	    3. Spruce up the login, signup, and payment pages
		4. Error messages for invalid login attempts, etc.
	    5. SID for better security than a cookie with account ID

	Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
	    1. Additional account page info; collect other information for accounts to display & record
	    2. Match each account.html button with a page
	    3. Port forward


LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
		1. Scripting console.html
		2. Market for online-hosted trade
		3. SSL

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		3. Coalitions
		4. Hunt submission
		5. Real about.html
		6. Some kind of news feed on home.html when logged in
		7. Real home.html
