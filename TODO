LESS IMPORTANT
	Work:
	    1. Fix page <title>s, most are wrong
		2. Scripting console.html
		3. Overhaul of request handling; should be abstracted class like Response
		4. That last account.html button should be a messages page (can send and recv from any user)
		5. Improve page CSS and add "aesthetic features"
		6. Validator cookie should be dynamic with session for increased security
		7. SSL
		8. Input field tooltips (on question marks beside)
		9. Thread for eval/exec(input()) so we can do maintenance without restarting the server
		10. Account settings; ability to change password, etc.
		11. Passwords should be stored using homemade encryption (sha is too irreversible - yeah we sneaky like that)
		12. Change bans to IP as well

	Creative vision:
		1. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
		2. Coalitions (shared pools) / Guilds (companies)
		3. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
		4. Hunt submission
		5. Real about.html
		6. Some kind of news feed on home.html when logged in
		7. Real home.html
		8. Unlockables/Progress page (for coalitions, hunt submission, etc.)
		9. Treaty
		10. Market for online-hosted trade
		11. Port forward
