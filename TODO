Work (anyone can do):
    1. Login action (use cookie)
    2. Success/failure pages for certain actions
    3. Something like google api's render() that allows files sent to use syntax for getting program variables (most importantly accounts, something like [[account_id|account_var]])
    4. Scripting console.html (not really important but it would please me to see it working)

Creative vision (probably Yovel should do):
    1. Hunt action
    2. Creating pages for each action to occur
