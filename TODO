Upon completion of all URGENT (and some IMPORTANT as deemed necessary) work, Project Mercury can move into a Closed Beta


URGENT
    1. Fix page <title>s, most are wrong; all Horothian Trade League should be replaced with Project Mercury for now
    2. When you hover over a message there should be a button that appears so you can delete it
    3. Input field tooltips (on question marks beside)

IMPORTANT
    1. Thread for eval/exec(input()) so we can do maintenance without restarting the server
	2. Improve page CSS and add "aesthetic features"
	3. Account settings; ability to change password, etc.
	4. Passwords should be stored using homemade encryption (sha is too irreversible - yeah we sneaky like that)
	5. Change bans to IP as well
	6. Unlockables/Progress page (for coalitions, hunt submission, etc.)

LESS IMPORTANT
    1. Overhaul of client request; should be abstracted class like Response, not a list of header options
    2. Validator cookie should be dynamic with session for increased security
    3. Coalitions (shared pools) / Guilds (companies)
    4. Hunt action, hunts.dat, hunts.html
    5. Scripting console.html

FINAL PRODUCT:
    1. SSL
    2. Port forward
    3. Treaty
    4. Hunt submission
    5. Market for online-hosted trade
    6. Real about.html
    7. Real news.html
    8. Real home.html
    9. console.html commands (not the basic scripting)
    10. Have dummy file with everyone in school for potential unlocking of the whitelist
