-OH MY GOD how did you make this!?!? / how-make
The question you're asking is like asking how someone wrote a book - they wrote it. There's no intricate process or method here, I just made this.

-But like, HOW? / how
I bit-by-bit created each page and the code that runs it. There's not much else I can explain other than a list of the order in which I added features.

-How long did it take you to make? / how-long
I've been working on this heavily since late December - it's consumed about a third of my personal free time for five months. Granted, I wake up early sometimes.

-Was this hard to make? / was-hard
In general, the fancier a feature looks on the surface, the easier it was to make. Case in point, my fanTASTIC messaging service took only a couple hours to build. The goddamn Coalition system took most of a week before I got it working right.

-How did you program it? / how-code
I used a combination of four different programming languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for what you see, of course, and I went with Python to build my own web server from scratch.

-Why is the URL 'projectmercury.asuscomm.com'? / why-url
Well apparently ASUS has a service for their routers where you can get them a domain name like that, so... that's what I did.

-Why can't I use HTTPS? / no-https
Look it's very hard and I keep getting errors so don't make me think about it.

-How does this work? / how-work
You can go to the HUNTS tab and do one of my hunts. This is basically me paying you for services, although the money comes from the Central Bank. You can use those credits for other things, if people want them.

-Why do you get to pay people from the Central Bank? / cb
I think the government should be paying from the treasury, no? I'm literally broke.

-Then how are you a part of this? /how-part
You have taxes for a number of transactions. Coalitions and Guilds can change this.

-TAXES!? / taxes
I can't complete my own hunts, so your transactions are taxed for me. If I start getting too rich, I'll lower taxes. If people get angry at the OUTRAGEOUS FIVE PERCENT that they lose, I'll lower taxes.

-People don't have many credits right now. / inflation
Well according to the laws of inflation, those credits are worth significantly more now than they will be once more money's been introduced to the economy.

-This is dumb. / dumb
Okay.

-This is great. / great
Thanks.

-How can I make money with this? / how-money
There's never a central authority which determines the exact worth of a currency - that is always decided by its users. If you want to pay someone for a few credits, then you've suddenly put a real value to it, and you might be able to encourage others to buy credits from you.

-Isn't this just like Bitcoin? / bitcoin
Yes. But Bitcoin doesn't have Coalitions, Hunts, and Email.

-Why is this person not authorized to join? / authorized
I haven't put their name in a master list yet, and that's probably for a good reason. Or maybe they just have to ask me to add them.

-Are you able to see my password? / see-pass
It's encrypted twice over on the server. It handles all the decryption automatically, so I can't look inside or something and see the passwords anyway.

-Can your server be hacked? / hackable
While anything could potentially be hacked, I can confidently say that, having built the entire system from scratch, I would not able to hack my own server.

-Why are you collecting emails and phone numbers? / why-email
No good reason. They're not used for anything, and it doesn't actually matter what you put there. If you don't feel comfortable telling me, even though I already have your Emery email, then don't, I guess.

-What's the difference between a Guild and a Coalition? / gc
A Guild is basically a company. It can have up to 20 people. A Coalition is just a pool of money. You can split that with 4 friends.

-Why do I keep seeing an error? / error
Well the simplest explanation is that you're doing something wrong. If you're seeing an error when you think you're doing it correctly, PLEASE tell me the error code or it won't get fixed

-I think something's unfair. / unfair
Make a Court Appeal and cite your grievances.

-Aren't you in total control though? / control
If you want to accuse me of embezzlement then please make a Court Appeal and, again, cite your grievances. I'm in control and that's what makes the project exist.

-I feel like this is a sort of nation you're building. I want to elect a leader in your place. / nation
Maybe one day, if this sticks around long enough.

-There aren't any hunts available! / hunts
Make a Guild and start selling your own stuff.

-[vital feature] is broken. Can you fix it? / broken
When I get home, I'll fix it as fast as humanly possible. I can't do much at school since the server runs at home.

-Your treaty is making me nervous. / treaty
Okay.

-Can you add feature [feature]? / add
You can ask me in person and I'll tell you how feasible I think that is. As well as I did it all so far, some things are more impossible to code than you'd think.

-Alright well this is pretty neat. / neat
Thanks.
