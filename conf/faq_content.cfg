-OH MY GOD HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS!?!??!? / how-make
The question you're asking is like asking how someone wrote a book - he wrote it. There's no intricate process or method here, I just made this.

-How long did it take you to make? / how-long
I've been working on this heavily since late December - it's consumed about half of my personal free time for five months.

-How did you program it? / how-code
I used a combination of four different programming languages - I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, of course, but I went with Python to build the web server from scratch.

-How can I make money with this? / how-money
There's never a central authority which determines the exact worth of a currency - that is always decided by its users. If you want to pay someone for a few credits, then you've suddenly put a real value to it, and you might be able to encourage others to buy credits from you.

-Why is this person not authorized to join? / authorized
I haven't put their name in a master list yet, and that's probably for a good reason.
