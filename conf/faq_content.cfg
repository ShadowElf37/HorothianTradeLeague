-OH MY GOD HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS!?!??!? / how-make
Now looky here. The question you're asking is like asking how someone wrote a book - he wrote it. There's no intricate process or method here, I just made this.

-Did you just make this over spring break? / how-long
Now looky here. That's like asking someone if they wrote a book in one week. I've been working on this heavily since late December - it's taken up about half of my personal free time for five months.

-How did you program it? / how-code
Umm... I used a combination of four different programming languages - HTML is the content, CSS is the looks, JavaScript is the fancier functionality, and I used Python to build the web server.
