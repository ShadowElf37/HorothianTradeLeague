-Launch at Last/
December of last year was around the time that Bitcoin peaked in value, which is what ultimately got me thinking about currencies. Bitcoin, if you strip away all the hype and "value" it has, is just a number assigned to each individual which represents some buying power <i>within that system</i>. Maybe I could make a system like it.
I was hoping, then, that we would be revising essays or something at the Project's launch so that I could have a hunt all ready for use. Fortunately, I got most of this done in time for that.
Anyway, now it's come to the grand opening. Hopefully it doesn't crash. It'll probably crash. I'm very sorry.
